# mouseTraceHaskell

Uses Haskell/Reflex to leave a trail of dots in an SVG element. For a demo, follow this link: http://dc25.github.io/mouseTraceHaskell_slowreflex_6f7aedfd57678b6e5c46dff3657dc60d40efe427/ .  You should see a rectangle on the screen.  Moving the pointer inside the rectangle causes a trace to appear.
